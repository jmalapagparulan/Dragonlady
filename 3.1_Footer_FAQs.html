                    How likely am I to be accepted for a loan?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            The only way to find out if you'll be accepted for a loan is to apply.
                            Moreover, the lender will be checking if you have a previous balance, if you don't have, your application for a loan would likely be accepted.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    What if my financial circumstances change during a loans term?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            Even if your financial circumstances chang during a loans term, you can just approach the lender.
                            The contacts are in the Contact Us section. All information on howw to reach the lender caan be seen under that section.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    How often can I apply for a loan?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            You can apply for a loan as long you don't have a current balance that you are not yet paid.
                            It is more likely that your appllication will be disapproved if you have a current unpaid loan.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    What is the minimum/maximum loan amount that may be granted to borrowers?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            The minimum amount that can be loaned is Php 500, while the maximum amount that can be granted to the borrowers is Php 100,000.   
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    How long do I need to pay the loan (full life of the loan)?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            The life of the loan depends on the amount of money you applied for.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    For what purposes can the money I borrow be used for?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            You can use the money you borrowed for any reasons you deemed necessary to use for.
                            The lender doesn't need to know where you will use the money for.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    What are the different loan terms I can apply for?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            It varies, but the loan terms can be seen when you try to apply for a loan.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    What is the interest rate?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            The interest rate is lower compared to most loaning companies.
                            The ratte can also be seen when you ttry to applly for a loan.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    What will be my monthly repayment?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            The monthly payment will depend on the amount of money you borrowed.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    What are my payment options?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            Since the payment options improved, we now accept payments via GCash, PayMaya, Paypal, BDO, and of course, the traditional walk-in.
                        </p>
    
                    <br>
                    How quickly will I receive the funds if my loan is approved?
                    <br>
                    
                        <p>
                            Once the loan was approved, you will immediately get a text message that your loan is approved.
                            By that, you will receive the money you need through the mode of loan transfer you inputted when you applied for a loan.
